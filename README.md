# Steam integration for Backloggd

![Logo](icons/logo.png)

A firefox extension used for the website https://backloggd.com/
It adds next to the "More Info on IGDB" text a button that leads to the steam page of the game.

You might need https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/ to get it working.
I also got issues with my adblocker while trying it, so you might need to disable it.


Using the steam api : https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v2/
